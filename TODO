  * ✅ Complete manual pages (man 8) with examples
  * ✅ Proper installation to standard directories

  ✅ Modern Build System
  * ✅ Unified hfsutil binary with all traditional commands
  * ✅ Robust Makefile with variable support (CC, CFLAGS, PREFIX, etc.)
  * ✅ Automatic symlink generation
  * ✅ Comprehensive test suite
  * ✅ CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions

  ✅ Documentation
  * ✅ Complete manual pages for all utilities
  * ✅ Updated README with modern usage examples
  * ✅ GitHub Copilot development instructions
  * ✅ Comprehensive build and installation documentation

REMAINING TODO ITEMS:

  libhfs improvements:
  * don't allow reads from spared blocks
  * further improve efficiency of b*-tree searches
  * concurrency considerations: opening same file multiple times
  * b*-tree record balancing
  * smarter block allocation algorithm
  * improve efficiency of bitmap operations
  * CNID wrapping handling
  * bad block sparing by physical block

  librsrc enhancements:
  * determine resource sizes without reading them
  * support writability

  command-line tools:
  * preserve timestamps (-p) for hcopy
  * recursive hcopy (-r)
  * allow hformat to create files and/or set size
  * more flags for hdel (-i, -r, -f)
  * improve glob pattern handling
  * formalize hdisk.pl into the distribution

  copyin/copyout:
  * finish/fix timestamp preservation
  * revisit buffer sizes
  * remember src/dst filenames (for preserve/delete)
  * allow name mangling to be optional
  * don't unconditionally clobber
  * delete incomplete files after failed transfers
  * AppleSingle, Netatalk-/CAP-style AppleDouble support

  code quality:
  * ✅ fix compilation warnings (setreuid/setregid return values)
  * improve error handling consistency
  * add more comprehensive error messages
  * memory leak detection and fixes

Future wish-list:

  * raw SCSI access for specialized platforms
  * partitioning utility
  * defragmenting utility
  * HFS+ journaling support
  * Extended attributes support
  * Case-sensitive HFS+ support
  * Compression support

Acknowledged limitations:

  * null characters (ASCII 0x00) not supported in filenames
  * partition maps not managed with A/UX support
  * limited HFS+ advanced features (journaling, case-sensitivity)

===============================================================================

DEVELOPMENT STATUS:

The project has reached a major milestone with version 4.0.0, providing:
- Complete HFS+ filesystem creation and checking
- Unix standard utilities (mkfs.*, fsck.*)
- Modern build system and documentation
- Comprehensive testing and CI/CD

The core functionality is stable and ready for production use.
Future development focuses on performance improvements and advanced features.
