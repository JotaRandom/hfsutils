REMAINING TODO ITEMS:

  libhfs improvements:
  * don't allow reads from spared blocks
  * further improve efficiency of b*-tree searches
  * concurrency considerations: opening same file multiple times
  * b*-tree record balancing
  * smarter block allocation algorithm
  * improve efficiency of bitmap operations
  * CNID wrapping handling
  * bad block sparing by physical block

  librsrc enhancements:
  * determine resource sizes without reading them
  * support writability

  command-line tools:
  * preserve timestamps (-p) for hcopy
  * recursive hcopy (-r)
  * allow hformat to create files and/or set size
  * more flags for hdel (-i, -r, -f)
  * improve glob pattern handling
  * formalize hdisk.pl into the distribution

  copyin/copyout:
  * finish/fix timestamp preservation
  * revisit buffer sizes
  * remember src/dst filenames (for preserve/delete)
  * allow name mangling to be optional
  * don't unconditionally clobber
  * delete incomplete files after failed transfers
  * AppleSingle, Netatalk-/CAP-style AppleDouble support

  code quality:
  * âœ… fix compilation warnings (setreuid/setregid return values)
  * âœ… standardize Unix/Linux/BSD exit codes (fsck: 0,1,2,4,8,16,32,128; mkfs: 0,1,2,4,8)
  * âœ… improve error handling consistency with proper exit codes
  * âœ… add comprehensive code documentation and comments
  * âœ… professional function documentation format (NAME/DESCRIPTION/PARAMETERS/RETURNS)
  * âœ… enhanced inline code comments and explanations
  * âœ… proper error categorization and logging
  * memory leak detection and fixes
  * static code analysis integration

Future wish-list:

  * raw SCSI access for specialized platforms
  * partitioning utility
  * defragmenting utility
  * âœ… HFS+ journaling support (COMPLETED in v4.1.0)
  * Extended attributes support
  * Case-sensitive HFS+ support
  * Compression support
  * GUI utilities for desktop environments
  * Integration with system mount utilities
  * Performance benchmarking suite

Acknowledged limitations:

  * null characters (ASCII 0x00) not supported in filenames
  * partition maps not managed with A/UX support
  * limited HFS+ advanced features (case-sensitivity, compression)
  * journaling replay only (no journal creation for new volumes)
  * no support for HFS+ extended attributes yet

===============================================================================
