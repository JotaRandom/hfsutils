========

Tools for Reading and Writing Macintosh HFS Volumes
--------------------------------------------------

hfsutils is a collection of tools for manipulating Hierarchical File System (HFS) volumes, the native format used by classic Macintosh computers. This modern port works on Linux, Unix-like systems, and BSD variants, providing a lightweight, terminal-based toolset for accessing HFS media.

This version (4.1.0A) is based on the original hfsutils by Robert Leslie (1996-1998), building upon Brock Gunter-Smith's Apple Silicon fork (4.0.0) with extensive additional modernization work. The package has been restructured to remove legacy Tcl/Tk/X11 dependencies, focusing on command-line utilities and C libraries with enterprise-grade features including HFS+ journaling support.

Installation
------------

**Prerequisites:**
- C compiler (gcc or clang)
- Standard Unix tools (make, bash)
- POSIX-compatible system

**Quick Build:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JotaRandom/hfsutils.git
cd hfsutils
./build.sh
sudo make install
```

**Manual Build:**
```bash
# Build libraries first
cd libhfs && ./configure && make && cd ..
cd librsrc && ./configure && make && cd ..

# Build main utilities
make

# Install system-wide
sudo make install
```

**Alternative Build (if autotools issues):**
```bash
# Use manual build target to avoid autotools completely
make build-manual
sudo make install
```

**Installation Options:**
```bash
# Standard installation
sudo make install

# Custom installation prefix
make install PREFIX=/opt/hfsutils

# Package building with staging directory
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/staging PREFIX=/usr

# Install with traditional command symlinks (hls, hcopy, etc.)
sudo make install-symlinks
```

**Distribution Packaging:**
```bash
# Standard distribution packaging
make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/package-root

# For distributions with merged /bin (like Arch, Fedora 17+)
make install PREFIX=/usr SBINDIR=/usr/bin DESTDIR=/tmp/package-root

# With symlinks for merged systems
make install-symlinks PREFIX=/usr SBINDIR=/usr/bin DESTDIR=/tmp/package-root
```

**Build Customization:**
```bash
# Custom compiler and flags
make CC=clang CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native"

# Environment-based build
export CC=gcc-11
export CFLAGS="-O2 -g -fstack-protector-strong"
./build.sh

# Cross-compilation
make CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc CFLAGS="-O2"
```

**Modern Systems Compatibility:**

Many modern Linux distributions have merged `/sbin` into `/bin` for simplicity. hfsutils automatically handles this:

- **Traditional systems** (RHEL/CentOS 6, Debian 7, Ubuntu 14.04 and older): Use default settings
- **Merged systems** (Arch Linux, Fedora 17+, Debian 8+, Ubuntu 15.04+): Use `SBINDIR=/usr/bin`

The build system automatically detects merged systems and creates appropriate symlinks. System utilities like `hfsck` are installed to `SBINDIR`, while user utilities like `hfsutil` go to `BINDIR`.

**Installation Variables:**
- `PREFIX`: Installation prefix (default: `/usr/local`)
- `BINDIR`: User binaries directory (default: `PREFIX/bin`)
- `SBINDIR`: System binaries directory (default: `PREFIX/sbin`)
- `DESTDIR`: Staging directory for package building

**Build Targets:**
- `make` - Build hfsutil executable and libraries
- `make install` - Install binaries, libraries, and manual pages
- `make install-symlinks` - Install with traditional command names
- `make symlinks` - Create command symlinks (for testing)
- `make test` - Run test suite
- `make clean` - Remove built files
- `make help` - Show all available targets and variables

For detailed build system documentation, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite for both HFS and HFS+ functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
cd test && ./run_tests.sh

# Run specific test categories
./run_tests.sh basic      # Basic functionality tests
./run_tests.sh hfsplus    # HFS+ specific tests
./run_tests.sh integration # Integration workflow tests
./run_tests.sh errors     # Error handling tests

# Generate test data (HFS and HFS+ images)
./generate_test_data.sh

# Run complete HFS+ validation
./test_hfsplus_complete.sh
```

**Test Coverage:**
- âœ… HFS volume creation, mounting, and file operations
- âœ… HFS+ volume formatting and structure validation
- âœ… Filesystem type detection (HFS vs HFS+)
- âœ… Program name detection (mkfs.hfs, mkfs.hfs+, fsck.hfs+)
- âœ… Mixed HFS/HFS+ environment compatibility
- âœ… Error handling and edge cases
- âœ… Build system validation across platforms

```

## Filesystem Utilities

hfsutils includes dedicated filesystem utilities that automatically detect and handle both HFS and HFS+ filesystems:

### Filesystem Checking (hfsck)

```bash
# Check filesystem (auto-detects HFS/HFS+)
hfsutil hfsck /dev/disk1s2

# Check with verbose output
hfsutil hfsck -v /dev/disk1s2

# Check without repairs (read-only)
hfsutil hfsck -n /dev/disk1s2

# Standard names (via symlinks)
fsck.hfs /dev/disk1s2      # Forces HFS checking
fsck.hfs+ /dev/disk1s3     # Forces HFS+ checking
```

### Filesystem Formatting (hformat)

```bash
# Format as HFS (default)
hfsutil hformat -l "My Disk" /dev/disk1s2

# Format as HFS+ (fully implemented)
hfsutil hformat -t hfs+ -l "My HFS+ Disk" /dev/disk1s2

# Force format (overwrite partitions)
hfsutil hformat -f -l "New Disk" /dev/disk1

# Standard Unix filesystem utilities
mkfs.hfs -l "My Disk" /dev/disk1s2        # Format as HFS
mkfs.hfs+ -l "My HFS+ Disk" /dev/disk1s2  # Format as HFS+
mkfs.hfsplus -l "My Disk" /dev/disk1s2    # Alternative HFS+ name

# Filesystem checking
fsck.hfs+ /dev/disk1s2                    # Check HFS+ volume
hfsck /dev/disk1s2                        # Auto-detect and check
```

**Filesystem Type Detection:**
- `hfsck` automatically detects HFS, HFS+, and HFSX filesystems
- `hformat` defaults to HFS, supports HFS+ with `-t hfs+` option
- Standard names (`fsck.hfs+`, `mkfs.hfs+`) enforce specific filesystem types
- Program name detection: utilities behave based on how they're invoked
- All utilities handle the HFS date limit (February 6, 2040) gracefully

**Basic Examples:**
```bash
# Mount an HFS volume
hfsutil hmount /dev/disk2

# List files in current HFS directory
hfsutil hls

# List files with details (like ls -l)
hfsutil hls -l

# Copy a file from HFS to local system
hfsutil hcopy :filename ./filename

# Copy a file to HFS volume
hfsutil hcopy ./filename :filename

# Create and format a new HFS disk image
dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.hfs bs=1024 count=1440
hfsutil hformat -l "My Disk" disk.hfs

# Format as HFS+ (fully supported)
hfsutil hformat -t hfs+ -l "My HFS+ Disk" disk.img

# Check filesystem integrity
hfsutil hfsck -v disk.hfs

# Check volume information
hfsutil hvol
```

**Working with Disk Images:**
```bash
# Mount a disk image
hfsutil hmount disk_image.img

# Navigate and explore
hfsutil hls -la
hfsutil hcd :System:Extensions
hfsutil hpwd

# Copy files for recovery
hfsutil hcopy :important_file ./recovered_file
hfsutil hcopy :folder: ./recovered_folder -r

# Unmount when done
hfsutil humount
```

**Using Traditional Command Names:**
If you prefer the classic command names, create symlinks:
```bash
# Create symlinks (after building)
make symlinks

# Now you can use traditional commands
hls -l
hcopy :file ./file
hmount disk.img

# Or use standard filesystem utilities
fsck.hfs /dev/disk1s2
mkfs.hfs -l "My Disk" /dev/disk1s2
fsck.hfs+ /dev/disk1s3
mkfs.hfs+ -l "My HFS+ Disk" /dev/disk1s3
```

Developer Libraries
-------------------

hfsutils includes C libraries for developers who want to integrate HFS support into their applications:

**libhfs** - Core HFS filesystem library:
- Low-level HFS volume access
- File and directory operations
- B*-tree manipulation
- Volume formatting and mounting

**librsrc** - Resource fork library:
- Read Macintosh resource forks
- Resource data extraction
- Compatible with or without libhfs

**Usage Example:**
```c
#include <hfs.h>

hfsvol *vol;
hfsfile *file;

// Mount HFS volume
vol = hfs_mount("/path/to/volume", 0, HFS_MODE_RDWR);

// Open file
file = hfs_open(vol, "filename");

// Read data
char buffer[1024];
hfs_read(file, buffer, sizeof(buffer));

// Clean up
hfs_close(file);
hfs_umount(vol);
```

**Installation for Development:**
```bash
# Install libraries and headers
sudo make install

# Libraries will be installed to /usr/local/lib/
# Headers will be installed to /usr/local/include/
```

Troubleshooting
---------------

**Build Issues:**
For errors like "config.status: No such file or directory":
```bash
make clean
./build.sh

# For persistent issues, try a complete clean
make distclean
./build.sh
```

**Common Problems:**
- **"config.status: No such file or directory"**: Run `./build.sh` to configure libraries
- **Permission denied on devices**: Use `sudo` or add user to appropriate groups
- **"hfsutil: command not found"**: Ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your PATH

**Runtime Issues:**
```bash
# Check if volume is already mounted
hfsutil hvol

# Force unmount if needed
hfsutil humount -f

# Verify HFS volume integrity
hfsutil hfsck /path/to/volume
```

**Permission Issues:**
For installation problems:
```bash
sudo make install
```

**Security Notes:**
- Do not install as setuid root; itâ€™s unnecessary and risky.
- Use device permissions or setgid for device access if needed.
- Consider using proper group membership for controlled device access in multi-user environments
