.SH NAME
fsck.hfs+ \- check and repair an HFS+ filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsck.hfs+
[-fnvy] [-b
.IR size ]
.I device
.RI [ partition-no ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fsck.hfs+
checks an HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus) filesystem and optionally
repairs any errors found. This is the standard Unix filesystem checking
utility for HFS+ filesystems.
.PP
HFS+ is the extended version of HFS with support for larger volumes, longer
filenames, Unicode support, and improved metadata handling.
.PP
The
.I device
argument specifies the block device or file containing the HFS+ filesystem
to be checked.
.PP
If the filesystem is mounted, only a read-only check will be performed unless
the
.B -f
option is used to force checking.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -f
Force checking even if the filesystem appears clean or is mounted.
.TP
.B -n
No-write mode. Check the filesystem but do not make any changes.
Useful for examining a filesystem without risk of modification.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose mode. Display detailed information about the checking process,
including details about HFS+ specific structures.
.TP
.B -y
Assume "yes" to all questions. Automatically repair any errors found
without prompting for confirmation.
.TP
.BI -b " size"
Specify the block size for the filesystem check.
.TP
.B --version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.B --license
Display license information and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
fsck.hfs+ /dev/sdb1
Check the HFS+ filesystem on the first partition of the second SCSI disk.
.TP
fsck.hfs+ -v /dev/sdb1
Check the filesystem with verbose output showing HFS+ specific information.
.TP
fsck.hfs+ -y /dev/sdb1
Check and automatically repair any errors found without prompting.
.TP
fsck.hfs+ -n /dev/sdb1
Check the filesystem in read-only mode without making any changes.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B fsck.hfs+
returns one of the following exit codes:
.TP
.B 0
No errors were found.
.TP
.B 1
Errors were found and corrected.
.TP
.B 2
Errors were found but not corrected.
.TP
.B 4
Operational error.
.TP
.B 8
Usage or syntax error.
.SH NOTES
HFS+ filesystems support advanced features like journaling, case-sensitivity,
and extended attributes. The checker validates these structures in addition
to basic filesystem integrity.
.PP
It is recommended to unmount the filesystem before running
.B fsck.hfs+
to ensure data integrity during the check and repair process.
